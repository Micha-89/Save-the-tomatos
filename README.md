# Save-the-tomatos

A game based on the google dinosaur game, but in a fantasy world setting, with a little story attached to it. 

I built this game using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the P5.js library. 

The main goal was to put my knowledge of object-oriented programming and DOM manipulation into practice. 

The game is developed to use with Google Chrome on a laptop or PC. It is not mobile responsive and some features might look slightly different in other browsers.
